# Home Dashboard Project

## Description
This project aims to create a home dashboard using a Raspberry Pi interfaced with various hardware components to display text-based data on an LCD display. The user can toggle between different views using push buttons.

## Predicted Equipment / Tools
- **Python/CircuitPython**
- **Raspberry Pi 4b**: Serves as the primary computing device and interfaces with the hardware components.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Used to present the text data to the user.
- **Breadboard**: For prototyping and circuit connections.
- **Push Buttons**: To toggle between different views.
- **Jumper Wires**: For establishing connections between components and Raspberry Pi.

## Goals

### View 1: Date and Time
- Displays the current date, including the month, day, and year.
- Shows the current time, accurate down to seconds.

### View 2: Weather Dashboard
- Fetches and displays the current temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.
- Provides a forecast icon or text (e.g., sun, rain, clouds, windy).
- Includes an additional push button to toggle and display the weather forecast for the next day.

### View 3: Dinner Plan
- Shows a weekly dinner plan created by the user.
- If feasible, it will also display prep and cook time for each meal.

### View 4: Message Board
- Allows for the creation of a web interface to input messages.
- Displays these messages in this fourth view on the LCD.

## Future Extensions
- **Remote Control**: Implement a remote web control system to switch views without needing to press the physical push button.
- **Additional Views**: Integrate other informational views like news headlines, stock market updates, or personal reminders.
